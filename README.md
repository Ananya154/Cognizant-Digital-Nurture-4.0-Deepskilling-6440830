## Note:
All exercises were done on time during the respective weeks.  
Due to an unexpected system issue, the original files and commit history were lost for first 4 weeks.  
So I had to re-upload the folders from my local backups and available screenshots.

For proof of timely completion, please refer to the output `.docx` files in each week’s folder.
